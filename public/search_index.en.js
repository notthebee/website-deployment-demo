are a lot of VPS providers that offer servers for as little as $2 per month, but there are a few things that you need to consider when choosing a VPS provider:\n\nVirtualisation technology — make sure your provider uses KVM or Xen instead of OpenVZ. OpenVZ is a container based virtualisation technology used on the cheapest bottom of the barrel VPS plans. OpenVZ machines run an old Linux kernel which isn't supported by Wireguard, Docker and other modern software and the way OpenVZ is built lets your provider snoop on your activities and files very easily. Avoid it\nAn IPv4 address — this only applies to the ultra budget VPS options, but some of the providers only give you an IPv6 address. This is not as common nowadays, but because of the shortage of IPv4 addresses we might start seeing it more and more often\nLocation – pretty self-explanatory. If you want to watch American content – choose an American data center. If you want to torrent Linux ISOs, don't choose Germany or Austria because they have very strict anti-piracy laws. If you want to use your VPN for gaming, keep in mind that the further the server, the bigger the latency. If you're really serious about privacy, choose a VPS outside of the 14 eyes.\n\nIn this tutorial I will be using Linode\nSetting up an account\nAfter you sign up on the website and confirm your email, you're going to need to enter some details, including your name, address and credit card information. That's going to be pretty much the same for all VPS providers though sometimes they accept Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.\nCreating a VPS\nNext thing you need to do is add a server or as Linode calls it, a \"linode\". There's a lot of distros to choose from, if you want you can even go with Gentoo or Arch, but for this tutorial I'll go with the latest version of Ubuntu.\nYou'll also want to choose the location, I'm going to choose UK since it's the closest to me physically.\nWe're going to take the cheapest \"Nanode\" plan. And even if later on you decide to set up a mail server, a Nextcloud instance or a personal blog, this configuration will still be more than sufficient.\nLinode Label is not that important, and neither are tags. I'll call mine wolfgangsvpn.\nAfter that you'll need to choose a root password and upload an SSH key, which we're not going to do now, i'll explain why later. Lastly tick a box that says \"Private IP\" and click the create button on the right... and there we go, our server is now created.\nGenerating SSH keys\nNow you should see the control panel of your server, and while the server is starting, let's generate the SSH keys for it. Using a cleartext password to log in to your server is never a good idea since the password is not encrypted in transit and can be exposed on a hostile network. By creating an SSH key we're going to make it so that you can only log in to the server if you have the key file and the password, and at the same time the password is encrypted.\nIf you're using Linux you probably already know how to open the terminal, if you're on Mac you can find the Terminal app in your Applications folder, and on Windows 10 you'll need to open the PowerShell with administrator's privileges and install SSH using this command:\nPS C:\\&gt; Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Client*\n\nThis is the command that will generate our ssh keys. The RSA algorithm with 4096 key size is what I'd personally recommend, since it's sufficiently secure and widely supported.\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096\n\nPress Enter when asked for the key location to save it to the default one and then enter your password of choice.\nLogging in to the server\nBy now our server has started up and we're ready to log in. Copy the IP address from the server control panel, go back to the terminal and type in\nssh root@ip-address\n\nType yes, enter the root password that you specified in the first step and that's it, we're in.\nUpdating the OS\nFirst and foremost, let's update our operating system and software:\napt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get upgrade\n\nI'll also install my favourite text editor, feel free to use whatever you want though, for example nano.\napt install neovim\n\nCreating a user\nAs much as it's convenient to not have to enter a password every time, we need to create a user account that isn't root. Exposing root login on an SSH server is probably not a good idea even if you have multi factor authentication. Call me paranoid, but I think having to enter root password sometimes is the price I'm willing to pay for some sense of security. Type\nuseradd -G sudo -m wolfgang -s /bin/bash\n\nThat's going to create a user, set bash as default shell for him and permit sudo usage.\nAfterwards we'll need to create a password for our user, using\npasswd wolfgang\n\nEnter your password twice and we're good to go.\nCopying SSH key from host to the server\nNow that we've created our user it's a good time to copy the public SSH key to the server. Open a second terminal window for your local terminal and enter:\nLinux or Mac\nssh-copy-id wolfgang@ip_address\n\nWindows\ntype $env:USERPROFILE\\.ssh\\id_rsa.pub | ssh ip-address \"cat &gt;&gt; .ssh/authorized_keys\"\n\nYou'll be prompted to enter your password and once you do, go back to the terminal window with your server. Don't close the other window yet.\nRestricting SSH to key authentication\nNow that we've copied the SSH keys to the server we have to restrict authentication to the public key only. Let's edit the sshd configuration file\nnvim /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n\nFirst of all, let's change the default port. This won't do much for security, but it will help with those obnoxious SSH scanners that try to log in with default credentials. Not much, but the security logs will definitely get easier to read. You can use any port that's not taken by other services, but I prefer to use 69. Nice\n# Port 22\nPort 69\n\nNext, we need to disable password authentication so that you're only able to log in using a public key.\nPasswordAuthentication no\n\nLast but not least, let's also disable root login\nPermitRootLogin no\n\nNow save the file and restart the sshd service using\nsystemctl restart sshd\n\nNow without closing this window let's go back to our local machine and try to log in with our key:\nssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa wolfgang@ip_address -p 69\n\nIf you see the prompt to enter your key password, that means we're good to go. It's also a good idea to verify that we can't log in with our password anymore:\nssh wolfgang@ip_address -p 69\n\nThis should give us \"Permission denied\".\nCreating a server alias\nBut you might have noticed that this command is kind of long and annoying to type, so let's fix that. Create a file in the \".ssh\" folder in your home directory called \"config\" and edit it using your favourite text editor:\nnvim ~/.ssh/config\n\nHere we're going to create an alias for our VPS\nHost wolfgangsvpn # choose a name for your server   \n\tUser wolgang # the username of the user that we created\n  \tPort 69\n  \tIdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa # that's the location of our key file\n\tHostName ip_address # that's the IP address of our server\n\nSave and close, and now we can login to our server by simply typing ssh wolfgangsvpn\nIf you also don't want to see this wall of text every time you login, type in touch .hushlogin\nSetting up OpenVPN\nI know that Wireguard has been the hot new VPN protocol that everyone's been focused on lately, but in this video I'm going to use OpenVPN instead. Why? Because it has wider support when it comes to client applications and some of the applications that I'll be talking about in the 2nd part of this tutorial utilize OpenVPN. If you're interested in setting up a Wireguard server, there are a lot of tutorials on the Internet about it.\nNormally setting up an OpenVPN server takes some time since you need to install the packages, generate the keys, set up IPTables, write the config files for the server and the client. Thankfully, we won't do any of this in the tutorial and instead we'll use the OpenVPN road warrior script from a github user called Nyr - https://github.com/Nyr/openvpn-install. This script will do all the hard work for us and all we have to do is answer a few simple questions and download the config file at the end. Needless to say you shouldn't just go around executing random scripts you downloaded from the internet, so if you know some bash, read the script first and make sure there's nothing fishy in there. If you don't know any bash, maybe send it to a friend who does. When you done with the perusal of the script, click raw and copy the link from your browser.\nLog in to your server and install wget if you haven't already. Sometimes it comes with your OS image already, but sometimes it doesn't.\nsudo apt install wget\n\nNext, type wget, press Space and paste the link that you copied earlier. Press Enter\nNow let's launch the script\nsudo bash openvpn-install.sh\n\nThe script will ask you some questions, and in most cases you'll want to pick the default answer. For the port, you can either choose the default port, 1194, but I prefer to choose 443, since 1194 is known as \"the OpenVPN port\" and in some cases it can be blocked on your network. 443 is the same port that is used for HTTPS, but whereas HTTPS uses TCP, OpenVPN (in this configuration) uses UDP, so they won't conflict with each other.\nYou're also going to be asked which DNS you want to use. Feel free to choose whatever you like, but I normally choose 1.1.1.1\nAs for the client name, choose whatever you like.\nNow that the configuration is done, press any key and the installation process is going to start. It's fully automated and at the end you'll going to get a configuration file that we'll download to our local machine later on. The problem is that the script places the file in the root directory by default, and in order to download it later, we need to move it to our user's home directory and give ourselves the correct priviliges:\nsudo mv /root/thinkpad.ovpn ~\nsudo chown wolfgang thinkpad.ovpn\n\nWith this out of the way there's only one thing left to be done on the server's side, and that's to disable the logs. Let's edit the config file:\nsudo nvim /etc/openvpn/server/server.conf\n\nAnd change verb 3 to verb 0\nNow restart the OpenVPN service:\nsystemctl restart openvpn-server@server.service\n\nAnd there we go! A VPN that actually doesn't keep logs. Amazing.\nI also just noticed that the hostname of the server is \"localhost\", which is not cool for many reasons. So let's change it to something else, I'm going to call it \"wolfgangsvpn\"\nDownloading the config file\nNow all we need to do is to download the configuration file to our local machine so that we can actually use the VPN. Open a terminal on your local machine and type in sftp servername Next, download the file using the command get configname.ovpn. And finally type exit\nNow if you want to use this VPN for all your traffic, which I don't recommend, you can download Tunnelblick on Mac, OpenVPN Connect on Windows or load it into the NetworkManager on Linux. \nNice to have\nAt this point we have a barebones VPN server up and running. You can stop here and use it like you would normally use a VPN (in which case thanks for reading and i'm glad I could help), but if you want to know how to make it even more secure and add some features that are nice to have, like unattended upgrades, keep reading.\nOptional: Installing mosh\nNow, ssh is nice but it does get annoying sometimes, especially when you change your network and your connection drops immediately. Instead, I prefer to use mosh. There's no complicated config file shenenigans, you just install mosh on both your local and your remote machine, and after that you can simply use the mosh command as a drop-in replacement for ssh\nOptional: Setting up multi-factor authentication\nNow, public key authentication is probably secure enough for most, but if you want to be extra fancy, you can also add MFA or multi-factor authentication. The way it works is you install an app on your phone (there are a lot of open source apps on Android like AndOTP) and every time you log in you get a one time password in the app which you need to enter in order to log in. This provides an additional layer of security for your server which can be useful for some of us who are especially paranoid.\nThe first thing you have to do is to install google-authenticator-libpam Yes, the protocol is made by Google, but it's completely open-source and you don't have to use the Google Authenticator app on your phone, there are many open source options as I've already mentioned\nsudo apt install libpam-google-authenticator\n\nAfter that, launch the initialization script by typing google-authenticator . There, basically answer yes to all questions except for the one about multiple users and the one about 30 second tokens.\nOnce you've done that, you might have noticed a big QR code in your command line as well as the recovery codes. Make sure to write those codes down somewhere save, they'll be useful in case you lose the access to the app on your phone. After that what you need to do is launch the authenticator app on your phone, I'll use OTP Auth, add a new account and chooe \"Scan a QR code\". After you scan the code, the account will be added to the app. And we're done with the phone part for now.\nLet's go back to the server terminal and edit the authentication settings file for sshd:\nsudo nvim /etc/pam.d/sshd\n\nHere we'll comment out the line that says @include common-auth. Normally the two factor authentication will ask you for your user password and the one time password, but since we're already using a public key with the password, having to enter your password twice is slightly annoying. That way you'll only have to enter the public key password and the one time password.\nNext we need to add this line to the end of the file:\nauth required pam_google_authenticator.so\n\nLet's save the file and quit. Now we need to edit the SSHD configuration file to make SSH aware of the new authentication method:\nsudo nvim /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n\nHere we need to change the following lines:\nChallengeResponseAuthentication yes\nUsePAM yes\n\nAnd add a new line after UsePAM that says:\nAuthenticationMethods publickey,password publickey,keyboard-interactive\n\nThat's it, let's save the file and exit. And now let's restart the SSH service for the changes to take effect:\nsudo systemctl restart sshd\n\nAs I mentioned in the beginning, it's always a good idea to try and log in in a separate terminal window without closing the server session. Otherwise if you messed up you'll be locked out of the SSH and obviously you don't want that.\nIf you try to log in now you'll see that apart from the usual public key password you're also going to be asked for the one time password from your app. Once again, if you're using Gnome, you won't be prompted for the public key until you log out and log back in again, only the one time password from your phone app. Let's enter the password and voila! Now our server is secured by two-factor authentication.\nOptional: Unattended upgrades\nOne last thing that I want to show you today is unattended software upgrades. What this means is we're going to have a script that runs apt update and apt upgrade regularly, thus liberating us from the burden of having to log in to the server and do this manually. The server will also be rebooted for kernel updates, but since the reboot takes less than a minute, and since kernel updates are not very frequent, your VPN won't actually have much downtime because of the upgrades. You can also disable the automatic reboots if you prefer to do it yourself.\nSo the first thing we need to do is to install the unattended-upgrades package:\nsudo apt install unattended-upgrades apt-listchanges bsd-mailx\n\nNext, enable the stable security updates:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure -plow unattended-upgrades\n\nAfter that's done, let's edit the config file\nsudo nvim /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades\n\nHere we need to set our email address which is going to be used for update notifications:\nUnattended-Upgrade::Mail \"mail@example.com\";\n\nAnd then also enable automatic reboots, set up cleanup tasks for removing unused kernels and set the automatic reboot time at 5AM.\nUnattended-Upgrade::Automatic-Reboot \"true\";  # this is kind of obvious\nUnattended-Upgrade::Remove-Unused-Kernel-Packages \"true\";\nUnattended-Upgrade::Remove-Unused-Dependencies \"true\";\nUnattended-Upgrade::Automatic-Reboot \"true\";\nUnattended-Upgrade::Automatic-Reboot-Time \"05:00\"; # here we'll specify when we want our system to reboot\n\nThat's it! Let's see if it works\nsudo unattended-upgrades --dry-run\n\nSo now your system and all the packages will be updated automatically and you'll get an email every time an upgrade has been performed.\n","id":"https://notthebe.ee/blog/creating-your-own-vpn/","title":"Setting up an OpenVPN server from scratch on Ubuntu 20.04"},"https://notthebe.ee/blog/custom-seabios-bootsplash/":{"body":"\n    \n        \n    \n\nWARNING!

Both of these cards are pretty expensive (90-120€ and 50-70€ respectively) and difficult to source (sellers are often out of stock due to the high demand).\nSo I started looking for alternative solutions and eventually decided to buy an NGFF to Airport adapter and a BCM943224PCIEBT2 Airport card from a Macbook Air (18€ in total), and try my luck.\nSome considerations\n\nPlease bear in mind that this is a higly experimental method. The results might be different for you, and this is by no means a 100% final working method. There's no guarantee, so do it at your own risk\nMake sure you know what you're doing, since the guide involves taking the laptop apart and this process is not for the faint of heart.\n\nPreparations\nRemove Wi-Fi whitelist in your BIOS if you haven't done that yet.\nModify the NGFF adapter, since it won't fit into the T440p. Use diagonal pliers (cutters) to cut off a part of the adapter (be careful not to touch contacts on the left side – slightly left to a \"pb\" label on the picture):\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n\nDisassembly\nDissassemble the laptop – you will need to remove:\n\nExternal battery\nBig door\nCMOS battery\nWebcam cable\nFan cable\nDVD drive\nKeyboard and keyboard bezel\nBase cover assembly\n\nRefer to Lenovo Maintenance Manual for instructions. There are a few plastics snaps around the docking station connector that are pretty tight, apply a little bit of force when you take off the base cover assembly and it should come right off.\nAfter you removed the base cover assembly, disconnect the Ethernet controller here:\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n\nScrew the adapter to the motherboard and insert the Airport card into the adapter. Then, lift the Airport card from the adapter and try to \"sandwich\" the rear part of the Ethernet controller between the adapter and the card, as shown here (sorry for the madskillz):\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n\nFinally, connect the Ethernet card to the motherboard, screw it in and assemble the laptop.

Use cutters to remove it.\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n\nTurn the laptop on. It will display a message about CMOS battery and wrong checksum  – go to the BIOS settings and restore default settings.

If you try to install a card that wasn't approved by Lenovo, your laptop will simply refuse to boot\n\n    \n        \n    \n\nDisclaimer\n\nThis process is quite involved and requires at least a basic knowledge of Google and a steady hand. I provide zero warranty in case something goes wrong. This tutorial is fairly safe if you follow it carefully, but I'm not responsible for your laptop refusing to boot, taking fire, or shrinking in size.\nI'll be working on a Thinkpad T440p with BIOS version 2.52. I do not know whether it's going to work on other BIOS versions or any other Haswell Thinkpads since I only have T440p, but it's been reported to work on W540 and T540. The only way to find out is to try, and if something goes wrong you can always re-flash the original BIOS file.\nThis process does not remove the BIOS or Supervisor password\n\nGathering supplies\nApart from the laptop itself, you will also need:\n\na second laptop or desktop PC\na CH341a external programmer with an 8-pin clip, they're usually sold together on websites like eBay, Amazon or Aliexpress for about $10.\n\nAssembling the programmer\nBefore using the programmer you also need to assemble it. Align the red wire on the clip with number \"1\" on the adapter, raise the lever on the programmer and plug the clip in the programmer as shown. Put down the lever.\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n    \n\nInstalling software\nFirst, we need to install three things on our second computer: flashrom, UEFIPatch and thinkpad-uefi-sign. You'll also need to download the text file with patches.\nOn Linux you can simply install flashrom from your distro's repositories. On Ubuntu the command is sudo apt install flashrom\nIf you're on Mac you'll have to install the Homebrew package manager. After that you can install flashrom by simply typing brew install flashrom\nOn Windows, using flashrom is somewhat complicated since you'll need a special driver that can't be installed on 64-bit versions of Windows without some tinkering. You can find unofficial versions of flashrom with the USB drivers already included on the Internet, but use them at your own risk. The best option would be to follow this tutorial from an Ubuntu LiveCD.\nInstalling UEFIPatch is easy: simply download the right version for your operating system from the Github and unpack it. Remove both text files from the folder to avoid any confusion.\nAfter that, clone the thinkpad-uefi-sign Github repository or simply download the ZIP and unpack it into the same folder that you used for UEFIPatch.\n\n    \n        \n    \n\nPreparing the patches\nDownload the text file with patches from the video description, move it to the UEFIPatch folder and open it with your favorite text editor. Here we're going to put a hash symbol in front of every patch that we don't want to be applied. The two bottom patches that unlock advanced memory settings are already commented out, and since I'll be doing it on a T440p, I'll also comment out the patches for T440 and L540. The file also contains a patch that unlocks the hidden advanced settings in BIOS, but if you don't want that for some reason, put a hash symbol in front of the line. Save the file and quit.\n\n    \n        \n    \n\nDumping the BIOS\nTurn your laptop upside down, remove the battery and take off the base cover. Take a good look at the motherboard and eventually you'll see a BIOS chip. If you're doing it on a different laptop, your BIOS chip might be at a different location and you might need to take the laptop apart completely to access it.\n\n    \n        \n    \n\nNext, align the dimple on the top of the chip and the red wire on your programmer clip and put a clip on the chip. Don't plug the USB programmer into your second laptop yet and double check that your battery is removed. Be careful, anchor the clip on one side and then close it in on the other side. Look at it from all sides and make sure the clip sits tightly on the chip.\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n\nNext up we're going to plug the programmer into our second laptop and open a terminal. Go to UEFIPatch folder and type this command:\nsudo flashrom -p ch341a_spi -r bios1.img\n\nIf you get a \"No chip found\" error, unplug the USB programmer from the laptop and try to re-seat the clip on the chip. Sometimes the connection isn't strong enough, and usually fiddling with the clip helps.\nAfter flashrom has finished reading your chip, repeat the same command again, but this time replace the bios1 with bios2:\nsudo flashrom -p ch341a_spi -r bios2.img\n\nNext, we're going to compare the two BIOS dumps to make sure they're identical:\ndiff bios1.img bios2.img\n\nIf this returns nothing, we're good to go. But if it says \"Files are different\", you need to unplug the USB programmer, re-seat the clip on the chip and try again.\nAfter that's done, you can delete the second file since both  are identical anyway. DO NOT delete the first file, keep it somewhere safe: this is going to be your backup in case something goes wrong.\nNow, unplug the USB programmer so that you don't accidentally yank the clip. You can also leave the clip on the chip, since we'll have to put in back in a minute anyway.\nPatching the BIOS\nNow we're going to patch the BIOS file and remove the Wi-Fi whitelist. Make sure you have UEFIPatch and the BIOS file in the same folder and type\n./UEFIPatch bios1.img xx40_patches_v5.txt -o bios_patched.img\n\nAt this point we're pretty much done, but if you try and flash this BIOS file back to the chip, you'll get a laptop that beeps 10 times every time you turn it on. This means that the BIOS is unsigned and somebody tampered with it [I wonder who that was]\nTo avoid that, we need to sign the BIOS file. But first, let's install python3 and the pycryptodome package. On Mac you can do it by typing\nbrew install python3\n\nAnd on Linux you'll have to install Python3 using your distro's package manager.\nAfter that, type\npip3 install pycryptodome\n\nNext, go to the folder where you unpacked UEFIPatch and thinkpad-uefi-sign and type:\nthinkpad-uefi-sign/sign.py bios_patched.img -o bios_patched.img\n\nAnd there we go, \"image signed\". We can also verify the image by typing:\nthinkpad-uefi-sign/sign.py bios_patched.img -o bios_patched.img\n\nAs you can see, it says \"Signatures correct\"\nNow it's time to flash the modded BIOS back to the laptop.\nFlash the BIOS\nRe-connect the USB programmer to your second laptop and in case you removed the clip from the BIOS chip, put it on again.\nThe command we need to type now is\nsudo flashrom -p ch341a_spi -w bios_patched.img\n\nWait for it to finish, unplug the USB programmer and remove the clip.\nIMPORTANT: Unplug the USB programmer FIRST, and THEN remove the clip. You might damage your laptop otherwise.\nPut the lid back on the laptop, slide in the battery and turn the laptop on.\nVerify that the laptop boots to the OS and connects to Wi-Fi networks.\n\n    \n        \n    \n\nCongratulations! Your laptop is now free... as in connecting to all the Wi-Fi networks, I guess.\nIf you take a look at the BIOS menu, you'll also see a bunch of new settings such as power limits, ACPI states and so on.

To do that, you need to have the \"Hide extensions for known file types\" option disabled in the File Exporer Options.\nBooting up\nWith that done, you can now eject the microSD card from your computer. Now put the SD card into the Raspberry Pi, plug your Ethernet cable into the router and into the board, then finally plug the USB-C cable into it. In case you want to set your Raspberry Pi up with a monitor, you also need to plug in a monitor, a keyboard and a mouse into it at this point.\n\n    \n        \n    \n\nFor monitor users\nThe initial setup wizard on Raspberry Pi OS will guide you through the initial setup process, including changing the password and installing the updates. Afterwards, the installer will prompt you to reboot the board – do it and skip to the \"Dynamic DNS\" section.\n\n    \n        \n    \n\nLogging into the system\nNow you need to wait for about a couple of minutes while your little computer is booting up, and then let's open the browser again and go to the router's admin panel. \nGo to the page that lists all of the devices connected to the network and copy the IP address of the Raspberry Pi (it will most likely have the hostname raspberry).\nNext, open the Terminal on your host machine. You can use PowerShell on Windows.\nType the following command:\nssh pi@192.168.1.45 # Replace with Raspberry Pi's IP address\n\nYou can use right mouse button to paste text in Windows PowerShell.\nAnswer \"yes\" to the next question, and type raspberry when asked for a password. The password will not be shown on the screen, not even the asterisks, and that applies to all of the password fields in the Linux command line interface.\n\n    \n        \n    \n\nChanging the password\nFirst thing we need to do is change the default password to something more secure. We won't be setting up public-key authentication in this tutorial, since the SSH port isn't going to be exposed to the Internet. If you'd like to know more, check out this tutorial from Digital Ocean.\nIn order to change the password you need to type passwd , type your current password (raspberry), and then type your new password twice.\nInstalling updates\nNext thing we're gonna do is updating our operating system to all the latest versions of software. For that, type:\nsudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade\n\nAfter the installation is complete and you see the green command prompt again, type sudo reboot to reboot the board.\nSetting up dynamic DNS\nNow that all of the preparations are finished, we need to get ourselves a dynamic DNS hostname. Unless you're using a business broadband connection, your external IP address most likely changes dynamically every time your ISP feels like it. For that reason, we'll need to set up a dynamic DNS service. For this tutorial I'll be using a free plan from freedns.afraid.org . That being said, you can use any service you want, I'm not endorsing any particular one.\nAfter registering on the website and activating your account via email, click on the \"Add a subdomain\". Here, the things we need to change are:\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n\nSubdomain – put whatever you want here\nDomain – same\nDestination – by default it's going to have your current IP address in there, but you need to change it to 0.0.0.0 – that way we'll be able to test if our dynamic IP assignment software actually works.\nAfter that, type in the captcha and click on \"Save!\".\n\nInstalling and setting up ddclient\nNow we need to log back in to our Raspberry Pi, by typing this command in the PowerShell or Terminal:\nssh pi@192.168.1.45 # Replace with Raspberry Pi's IP address\n\nPro-tip: You can also press ↑ and that will give you the last command you entered. Next, enter the new password that you created earlier.\nNow we need to install a piece of software called ddclient:\nsudo apt install ddclient \n\nand press Enter. It's going to ask you for some things so just pretend you don't know anything by typing \"Enter\" until it gives up.\nNow we need to tell ddclient which address it needs to update: \nsudo nano /etc/ddclient.conf\n\nLet's just delete all of the lines in the file and replace them with this:\ndaemon=5m\ntimeout=10\nsyslog=no # log update msgs to syslog\n#mail=root # mail all msgs to root\n#mail-failure=root # mail failed update msgs to root\npid=/var/run/ddclient.pid # record PID in file.\nssl=yes # use ssl-support. Works with\n# ssl-library\n\nuse=if, if=eth0\nserver=freedns.afraid.org\nprotocol=freedns\nlogin=YOUR FREEDNS LOGIN\npassword=YOUR FREEDNS PASSWORD\nyour.freedns.domain\n\nAfter that's done press Control+O to save the file and Control+X to exit.\nAnother file that we need to edit is /etc/default/ddclient. Here we need to change everything to false except for the run_daemon option. This one we need to change to true. Once that's done, Control+O, Control+X.\nNow that all of the configuration is done, let's restart the ddclient service:\nsudo systemctl restart ddclient\n\nLet's check the service status now:\nsudo systemctl status ddclient\nFeb 16 15:05:25 raspberrypi ddclient[1806]: WARNING: Connection: close\nFeb 16 15:05:25 raspberrypi ddclient[1806]: WARNING: Vary: Accept-Encoding\nFeb 16 15:05:25 raspberrypi ddclient[1806]: WARNING: Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate\nFeb 16 15:05:25 raspberrypi ddclient[1806]: WARNING: Cache-Control: post-check=0, pre-check=0\nFeb 16 15:05:25 raspberrypi ddclient[1806]: WARNING: Pragma: no-cache\nFeb 16 15:05:25 raspberrypi ddclient[1806]: WARNING: Expires: Mon, 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT\nFeb 16 15:05:25 raspberrypi ddclient[1806]: WARNING: X-Cache: MISS\nFeb 16 15:05:25 raspberrypi ddclient[1806]: WARNING:  \nFeb 16 15:05:25 raspberrypi ddclient[1806]: WARNING: Updated 1 host(s) your.freedns.domain to 13.37.420.69\nFeb 16 15:05:25 raspberrypi ddclient[1806]: **FAILED: updating your.freedns.domain: Invalid reply.**\n\nAs you can see it actually says FAILED, but if you go back to our browser and refresh the page with the subdomain, you should see that 0.0.0.0 changed to your real IP address.\nFinally, let's make sure ddclient starts automatically every time we power our Raspberry Pi on:\nsudo systemctl enable ddclient\n\nSetting up port forwarding\nSet up a new port forwarding entry for Raspberry Pi in your router's administration panel. The settings are as follows:\n\nDevice: Raspberry Pi's hostname or IP\nProtocol: UDP\nPort range: 51820-51820\nOutgoing port: 51820\nPermit Internet access: yes\n\nHere's what the settings look like on a FritzBox router:\n\n    \n        \n    \n\nInstalling Wireguard VPN\nCopy and the following command into the terminal (while logged into RPi):\nwget https://git.io/wireguard -O wireguard-install.sh &amp;&amp; sudo bash wireguard-install.sh\n\nThe script is going to ask you for the hostname that you want to use for the VPN – type your dynamic DNS domain that we created earlier.\nFor client name, just put any name you want, and for DNS, this is kind of personal preference – I personally use 1.1.1.1\nFollow the instuctions on the screen further and wait until the installation is finished.\nImportant: You will need to add a new user for every device that you use with the VPN. To add a new user, simply re-run the script and follow the instructions.\nConnecting to the VPN from a phone\nInstall the Wireguard app from Google Play or App Store\nWireguard (Google Play): https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wireguard.android \nWireguard (App Store): https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wireguard/id1441195209 \nScan the QR code shown in the terminal using the function Create from QR code in the app.\n\n    \n        \n    \n\nDisconnect from the WiFi and test the VPN connection using cellular network. Your can check your external IP address here.\nConnecting to the VPN from a PC (Windows)\nConnecting to our VPN from a computer requires a few additional steps. \nFirst, we need to move the configuration files to our home directory. For that, log in to the Raspberry Pi from the terminal, and type:\nsudo su\ncp /root/*.conf /home/pi\n\nCreate a folder for the Wireguard configuration files in Windows Explorer. Go to that folder, right-click on the empty space and click \"Open a PowerShell window here\". Press ↑ to get the latest command and replace ssh with sftp. Press Enter to execute.\nAfter you've entered your password, you can now copy the configuration file to your machine. For that, type get *.conf and press Enter. After the file is copied, type exit to quit the sftp interface.\nNow you can download the Wireguard desktop app and import the config file into it.\n\n    \n        \n    \n\nWireguard client apps: https://www.wireguard.com/install/\n","id":"https://notthebe.ee/blog/set-up-your-own-vpn-on-raspberry-pi/","title":"Set up your own VPN at home with Raspberry Pi"},"https://notthebe.ee/blog/split-vpn-tunnelling-for-selected-applications/":{"body":"\n    \n        \n    \n\n\nSometimes you need to use VPN for a few selected applications, but not for your whole Internet traffic. However, most operating systems do not include that functionality. \nIn this tutorial we will create a local proxy for our VPN using Docker and binhex/arch-delugevpn\nWindows\nInstalling WSL2\nIMPORTANT: At the moment of writing, Microsoft's version of the Linux kernel does not include the Wireguard module by default. You can try your luck by compiling the kernel and the module manually, but I didn't manage to make it work on my machine. Hence, I recommend using OpenVPN with Windows.\nOpen the start menu and type “Turn\". Click on the first result, Turn Windows features on or off. Here we need to enable two things — Virtual Machine Platform and Windows Subsystem for Linux.\n\n    \n        \n    \n\nYou can also do the same by typing the following commands in Powershell:\ndism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart\ndism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart\n\nAfter that, we need to restart Windows to complete the installation – press the Restart now button.\nAfter Windows starts up, go to the Start Menu again and type \"power\". Open PowerShell and type wsl --set-default-version 2. After that, download the Linux kernel update for WSL2 and install it.\nInstalling Docker Desktop\nDownload Docker Desktop for Windows from the official Docker website. After the installation is complete, press Close and log out.\nInstalling Ubuntu 20.04\nAfter you log back in, you'll see the Docker Desktop screen. But before configuring docker, we need to install a WSL distro from which we're going to use in order to manage our container. \nOpen Microsoft Store and search for your favorite distribution. Personally, I recommend Ubuntu 20.04 LTS\nOnce that's installed, click on \"Launch\". Type in your desired username and password in the terminal, and after that you should get the bash prompt. \nNow go back to Docker Desktop, open the Settings and untick the \"Send usage statistics\". Then, go to Resources &gt; WSL INTEGRATION and enable \"Ubuntu 20.04\". Close the Linux terminal window and open it again from the Start menu.\n\nCreating folders and writing a compose file\nIn the Linux terminal, type:\nmkdir -p /mnt/c/Users/WINDOWS_USER_NAME/docker/arch-delugevpn/data\nmkdir -p /mnt/c/Users/WINDOWS_USER_NAME/docker/arch-delugevpn/config/openvpn\nmkdir -p /mnt/c/Users/WINDOWS_USER_NAME/docker/arch-delugevpn/config/compose\n\nThis will create a folder named docker in your Windows user's directory and all the necessary subfolders. \nNow create a file named docker-compose.yml in the compose folder with the following contents:\nversion: '3'\nservices:\n        delugevpn:\n                container_name: delugevpn\n                image: binhex/arch-delugevpn:latest\n                restart: unless-stopped\n                cap_add:\n                        - net_admin # Necessary for OpenVPN\n                ports:\n                        - 0.0.0.0:8112:8112\n                        - 58846:58846\n                        - 0.0.0.0:8118:8118\n                environment:\n                        - VPN_ENABLED=yes\n                        - VPN_PROV=custom\n                        - VPN_CLIENT=openvpn\n                        - ENABLE_PRIVOXY=yes\n                        - LAN_NETWORK=192.168.178.0/24 # Replace with your network's IP\n                        - NAME_SERVERS=1.1.1.1,1.0.0.1\n                        - DELUGE_DAEMON_LOG_LEVEL=info\n                        - DELUGE_WEB_LOG_LEVEL=info\n                        - DEBUG=false\n                        - UMASK=000\n                        - PUID=1000\n                        - PGID=1000\n                        - TZ=Europe/Amsterdam # Replace with your timezone – check https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones for reference\n                volumes:\n                        - /mnt/c/Users/WINDOWS_USER_NAME/docker/arch-delugevpn/data:/data # Replace WINDOWS_USER_NAME with your actual username\n                        - /mnt/c/Users/WINDOWS_USER_NAME/docker/arch-delugevpn/config:/config\n                        - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro\n\nSome additional information for the parameters:\n\nVPN_PROV — set it to custom if you're using a self-hosted VPN. There are also some other options, such as pia or airvpn, check out the container documentation if you're interested\nVPN_CLIENT — You can set it either to openvpn or wireguard — once again, I couldn't make Wireguard work on Windows, so I will be using OpenVPN\nLAN_NETWORK — If you don't know the IP of your LAN network, open a PowerShell window and type ipconfig. Copy the first three numbers from the IPv4 Address field and paste them to the LAN_NETWORK field in the compose file. Append a 0 as the fourth number and add /24 at the end.\nIn the volumes section you need to expose the config and downloads folders, as well as the localtime file to the container. The latter will remain the same in any case, no matter which folders you created, but for the first two — put the path to the folder on your local machine on the left and the path in the container on the right. In this case, the container path for config folder is /config and the downloads are located in /data/incomplete by default, but you can put them anywhere and change the download path in the torrent client later.\n\nRunning the container\nOnce you're done, save the file and quit. Now we're ready to run our container — type docker-compose up -d. But once that's done — wait for about 10 seconds, and if you did everything correctly you should be able to see Privoxy process listening on port 8118 when you type docker logs delugevpn. \nWorking with Deluge\nOpen a browser and go to localhost:8112. You will get a password prompt and the default password here is \"deluge\". You can change it latter in the settings. \nPrivoxy proxy\nYou can now access the proxy by pointing your applications to localhost:8112. Here's an example of what that looks like in Firefox:\n\n    \n        \n    \n\nPrivoxy also features ad/tracker filtering and other functinonality. To access the settings, open http://config.privoxy.org in your browser.\nYou can also use FoxyProxy in Firefox for advanced whitelisting/blacklisting functionality with regular expressions.\nLinux\nOn Linux this whole process takes less than 5 minutes. Open a terminal and type the following commands:\nsudo pacman -S docker docker-compose # Will obviously differ depending on the distribution\nsudo usermod -aG docker username\nsudo systemctl enable --now docker\n\nmkdir -p /home/LINUX_USERNAME/docker/arch-delugevpn/data\nmkdir -p /home/LINUX_USERNAME/docker/arch-delugevpn/compose\nmkdir -p /home/LINUX_USERNAME/docker/arch-delugevpn/config/wireguard # If you're using Wireguard\nmkdir -p /home/LINUX_USERNAME/docker/arch-delugevpn/config/openvpn # If you're using OpenVPN\n\nThe docker-compose.yml will look a little bit different for Wireguard. In particular, we need to add the following lines:\n                privileged: true\n                sysctls:\n                        - \"net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark=1\"\n\nNow reboot. After booting up you can launch the container by running docker-compose up -d\nmacOS\nOn macOS the process is similar to Windows with a few exceptions:\n\nWireguard actually works\nDocker Desktop is available in Homebrew repositories. To install it, type brew cask install docker\nThe performance might be slightly inferior to Windows, since macOS doesn't feature WSL2\n\n","id":"https://notthebe.ee/blog/split-vpn-tunnelling-for-selected-applications/","title":"Split VPN tunelling for selected applications (Windows, Linux, macOS)"},"https://notthebe.ee/blog/windows10-ame/":{"body":"\n    \n        \n    \n\nPlease refer to the official AME documentation for an up-to-date version\nhttps://ameliorated.info/documentation.html\nDownloading and verifying Windows 10 ISO\nDownload the Windows 10 ISO using Fido (Windows-only) or TechBench. Choose a version that is officially supported by AME Project for the most stable experience, or alternatively, try your luck with the latest version. Make sure to choose the correct UI language, you can't change it after the installation.\nCalcualte the SHA1 sum of the ISO using sha1sum. \nUpdated 08.09.2020: You can also use this PowerShell commmand to calculate the SHA1 sum on Windows without any third party tools (Thank you, @GezeikVan)\nGet-FileHash -Algorithm SHA1 Windows_2004.iso\n\nUse AdGuard SHA1 catalog to verify the ISO checksum against the MSDN image database.\n\n    \n        \n    \n\nDownloading updates\nUse Windows 10 Update History page to determinte the KBs of the newest Cumulative update and the SSU for your Windows version. Look up the KBs in the Microsoft Update Catalog and download the update packages for your architecture.\n\n    \n        \n    \n\nCreating a bootable media\nUse Rufus to create a bootable USB drive from the Windows 10 ISO. On Linux you can use WoeUSB instead. Copy the update packages and Rufus executable to the flash drive. Download a Debian-based Linux LiveUSB image, for example Xubuntu and copy it to the USB drive as well. You might also want to add drivers for your PC. \nYou will also need the newest version of the Amelioration script from the AME website\nInstalling Windows\nDisconnect from the Ethernet/Wi-Fi and don't connect back until we run the Linux AME script. \nInstall Windows as usual and make sure to answer \"No\" to every question about telemetry/data collection/geolocation/etc.\nAfter the installation/setup process is complete, do the following things:\n\nUnpin all tiles from the Start menu\nRemove the search bar from the taskbar\nRemove task view icon from the taskbar\n\nThese settings might not be available after the \"amelioration\" process is finished.\nInstalling updates\nOpen the PowerShell as Administrator and type the following commands:\nmkdir C:/SSU\nmkdir C:/Cumulative\n\nGo to the flash drive, open the folder with the update packages, Shift+Right click on the empty space in Explorer and click \"Open PowerShell window here\". \nUnpack the updates. You can tell the SSU apart from the Cumulative update by comparing the package sizes: the SSU file is much smaller than the one for the Cumulative update.\nexpand -F:* name_of_the_ssu_package.msu C:\\SSU\nexpand -F:* name_of_the_cumulative_package.msu C:\\Cumulative\n\nInstall the SSU update first. Copy the filename of the CAB package from Explorer, since you won't be able to utilize auto-completion for the DISM command:\ndism /online /add-package /packagepath=C:\\SSU\\name_of_the_ssu.cab\n\nReboot after applying the SSU and install the Cumulative update:\ndism /online /add-package /packagepath=C:\\Cumulative\\name_of_the_cumulative.cab\n\nReboot twice after the Cumulative update has been installed.\nFinally, launch the cleanup task to get rid of the update cache:\ndism /online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup\n\nRunning the amelioration script\nOpen the flash drive folder and run the AME script as Administrator. Choose 1. Run Pre-Amelioration in the menu and wait for the process to finish\nAfterwards, choose 3. User Permissions. Reset the Administrator password and change your user privileges from \"Administrator\" to \"Standard User\".\nLog out when asked to, use the Ctrl+Alt+Del menu to log out manually if necessary.\nAfter logging back in, run PowerShell as Administrator and reset your password:\nnet user username *\n\nEnter the password twice. The symbols won't appear in the command line as you type.\nCreating a Linux bootable media\nCopy the flash drive folder to your desktop and use Rufus to wipe the Windows bootable flash drive and create a Linux USB drive. Reboot into BIOS, re-enable the Internet connection and then boot into Linux\nRunning the Linux amelioration script\nMount the Windows drive. Then, navigate to ameliorated.info and copy the download link for the Linux AME script. \nGo to the Windows drive, open the terminal in the root folder. Type sudo su and then type wget &lt;paste the download link&gt;. This will give you root privileges and download the AME script to the root of the Windows drive.\nAs of writing this, running the script produces an error due to incompatible newline symbols:\nbash: '\\r': command not found\n\nYou can either use a sed script to convert the newline symbols to UNIX ones: \nsed -i 's/\\r$//' filename\n\nAlternatively, use dos2unix:\napt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install dos2unix\ndos2unix filename\n\nNow you can run the script by typing bash filename.\nAfter the script is finished with no errors, you can now reboot into Windows with the Internet connection enabled.\nPost-Amelioration\nSince most of the default Windows applications, including Internet Explorer, Windows Media Player, Photos, etc. are eliminated, we need to install something to replace them.\nEdit the AME script that we ran for pre-amelioration and go to the following line:\nchoco install -y --force --allow-empty-checksums firefox thunderbird vlc youtube-dl 7zip open-shell jpegview vcredist-all directx onlyoffice\n\nAdd the -installArgs ADDLOCAL=StartMenu after the open-shell text in order to opt out of \"Classic Explorer\" part of the OpenShell (doesn't work on the current version of Windows as of writing this).\nBy default, the following applications are installed:\n\nFirefox\nThunderbird\nVLC\nJPEGView\nOpenShell (a Windows 7-style Start Menu replacement)\nOnlyOffice\n7Zip\nyoutube-dl\nVarious Windows runtimes (.NET, C++) and DirectX\n\nFeel free to replace or remove the applications in this list depending on your personal preferences.\nAfter making the adjustments, run the script as Administrator and choose 2. Run Post-Amelioration\nHardening Windows settings\nDownload Hardentools by Security Without Borders. Run the script as Administrator, reboot after the process is finished.\nChanging input language\nYou can remove/add a new input language using PowerShell.\n$List = Get-WinUserLanguageList\n$List.add(&lt;language-code&gt;)\n$List.remove(&lt;language-code&gt;)\nSet-WinUserLanguageList $List\n\nReplace &lt;language_code&gt; with your language code (e.g. \"ru\" for Russian or \"de-DE\" for German)\nInstalling drivers\nThe drivers can be installed by downloading the driver package (sometimes called \"SCCM\") for your machine, unpacking it in a folder and executing this command in an elevated shell:\npnputil.exe /add-driver C:\\MyDrivers\\*.inf /subdirs /install /reboot\n\n","id":"https://notthebe.ee/blog/windows10-ame/","title":"Windows 10 AME – Make Windows Suck Less!"},"https://notthebe.ee/impressum/":{"body":"Angaben gemäß § 5 TMG\nWolfgang's Channel\nOberstr. 3\n47829 Krefeld\nDeutschland\nKontakt\nE-Mail: wolfgangschannel[аt]mailbox.org\n","id":"https://notthebe.ee/impressum/","title":"Impressum"},"https://notthebe.ee/privacy/":{"body":"Privacy and data collection\nResponsible entity\nSee Imprint\nAccess logs\nThis website runs on Nginx, which collects access logs by default.
